# Rust, Raspberry, Linux kernel and more...

#### It all began with a question: "Can I do it?"

Frankly, I never had the courage of pushing myself so far so as to learn Rust (seriously?, who names a language as Rust).
Anyway, what started as a simple 2 hour visit and "check out" what a really "rust" is (as I prefer to call it, ferric-oxide, lol) turned out to be a serious love affair.
